 ## Quick start 

Once installed, let's run Hardhat's testing network:

```sh
npx hardhat node
```

Then, on a new terminal, go to the repository's root folder and run this to
deploy your contract:

```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network loctesalhost

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkerby
```
 
**Happy _buidling_!**
